# Hierarchical text classification using geometric deep learning:

A PyTorch-based implementation and the required material to accompany our EM-NLP 2021 paper
 "Classification of hierarchical text using geometric deep learning: the case of clinical trials corpus".

Our use case is the clinical trials data, which are hierarchically organized text. Along with text embedding using pre-trained transformers, the idea is to use graph deep learning to also capture the hierarchical structure.
